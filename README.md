# libFaceRecognition
Libraries for the development of face recognition applications with FaceVACS.
Wrapper classes for FaceVACS SDK, which are easier to use. Feel free to make suggestions / additions.

You will need a licensed FaceVACS SDK installation, the boost C++ libraries and CMake installed.


This is a part of the software that I developed during the experiments of my bachelor thesis.
You can ask the visio admin for permission for the private repository "FRexperiments" if you need more code.
